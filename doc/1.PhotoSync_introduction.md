# 📸 PhotoSync — About

**PhotoSync** is a photoshoot booking platform designed to streamline client communication and scheduling.
It is built as a modern, full-stack web application using:

* **Laravel 12** — Backend API (PHP)
* **Vue.js 3 (Vite)** — Frontend SPA
* **Neon PostgreSQL** — Cloud-hosted relational database
* **Google Cloud Run** — Backend container hosting
* **Vercel** — Frontend hosting & CI/CD

The architecture follows a clean separation:
**Frontend → API → Database**, fully cloud-native and using only free-tier services.

## 🏗️ Current Build Progress (Phase 1)

### **1. Project & Infrastructure Setup**

* Created GitHub repository (`photosync`)
* Created Neon PostgreSQL project + database (`photosync_db`)
* Created Google Cloud project (`photosync-backend-479418`)
* Enabled Cloud Run, Artifact Registry, Cloud Build
* Prepared accounts for Vercel hosting

### **2. Laravel Backend Setup**

* Installed **Laravel 12** in Cloud Shell
* Configured `.env`, generated **APP_KEY**, and connected to Neon
* Created `messages` table for storing Contact Us form submissions
* Created API endpoints (`POST /api/messages`, `GET /api/messages`)

### **3. Vue.js Frontend Setup**

* Created Vue 3 + Vite app in `/frontend`
* Added Vue Router with two pages:

  * **Dashboard** (welcome + “in progress")
  * **Contact Us** (email/message form)
* Implemented API integration using `VITE_API_URL`

### **4. Backend Deployment (Cloud Run)**

* Wrote Dockerfile and deployed Laravel as a container
* Built images via Artifact Registry
* Set all environment variables (APP_KEY, DB credentials)
* Tested `/api/messages` successfully in production

## ✔️ Status

The **entire foundational stack is running in production**:

* **Backend API** → Google Cloud Run
* **Database** → Neon PostgreSQL
* **Frontend (local dev)** → fully functional and integrated
* **Contact form** → stores messages in production DB

Next step: **Deploy frontend to Vercel** and point it to the Cloud Run API.
