# ✅ US-006:  Create the Vue 3 frontend (Vite) inside your repo

Goal:
Have a `frontend/` folder with a fresh Vue 3 app that we’ll later deploy to Vercel and connect to your Laravel API.

All commands below are in **Cloud Shell**, from your project root.

---

### 1️⃣ Go to your project root

Just to be safe:

```bash
cd ~/photosync
pwd
ls
```

You should see your Laravel files (`artisan`, `app/`, `routes/`, etc.).

---

### 2️⃣ Create a Vue 3 + Vite app in `frontend/`

Run:

```bash
npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template vue
```

* If it asks for options interactively, pick the defaults (Vue, JavaScript).

> ⚠️ If you get an error like `npm: command not found` or Node version issues, stop there and paste the error to me.

---

### 3️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

---

### 4️⃣ Quick dev test (optional but nice)

Still in `frontend`:

```bash
npm run dev
```

* If Cloud Shell gives you a URL or says it’s running on `http://localhost:5173`, that’s expected.
* You can stop it with `CTRL + C`.

(If this step fails, copy the error for me.)

---

### 5️⃣ Commit and push the new frontend

From `frontend`, go back to project root:

```bash
cd ..
git status   # you should see frontend/ as new
git add frontend
git commit -m "Add Vue 3 frontend with Vite"
git push origin main
```

---

👉 **Your turn:**
Do Task 4 and then tell me:

* Did `npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template vue` work?
* Did `npm install` (and optionally `npm run dev`) succeed?

Once that’s good, next task will be: **create the Dashboard + Contact Us pages in Vue and wire the Contact form to your Laravel API URL (placeholder for now).**
