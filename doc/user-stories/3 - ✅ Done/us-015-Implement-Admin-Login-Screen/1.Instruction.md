-   Updated the `User` model to include the `role` attribute.

### Frontend
-   Created `frontend/src/pages/AdminLogin.vue` for the login form.
-   Created `frontend/src/pages/AdminDashboard.vue` as a placeholder dashboard.
-   Added routes for `/admin/login` and `/admin/dashboard` in `frontend/src/router/index.js`.
