# **PhotoSync App: Streamlined Photoshoot Booking Platform**

The **PhotoSync App** connects clients seeking photographers for photoshoots with registered professionals.
Clients can post detailed job descriptions, while photographers browse opportunities, ask clarifying questions via messaging, and submit applications.
Upon selection, both parties can mark the job as completed and exchange mutual reviews. An admin oversees the ecosystem for quality control and moderation.

To ensure a smooth development process, development will prioritize **core functionalities first** to deliver a **minimum viable product (MVP)**.
Future iterations will add advanced features such as cancellation restrictions, payment integration, notifications, and a dedicated mobile app.
